# Compiler-Project
This repository contains a compiler design project by Ahmed Mohamed Mounir, John Medhat, and Amr Khaled Abdeltawab. It covers lexical analysis (tokenizing source code), syntax analysis (checking code structure), and semantic analysis (ensuring logical correctness). Each phase includes code snippets and screenshots illustrating the functionality.
